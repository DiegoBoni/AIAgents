# Requirements Breakdown

## When to use

Use this skill when a request is ambiguous or too broad for direct implementation.

## Workflow

1. Extract goals and constraints.
2. Split into functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Identify assumptions and open questions.
4. Produce prioritized implementation backlog.

## Output

- Structured requirements list with IDs.
- Priority and dependency map.
